/*
 * io_uring batch engine.
 *
 * Submits a whole batch of reads/writes with a single io_uring_submit(),
 * then reaps all completions — eliminating the per-request syscall of the
 * sync engine and letting the storage layer service requests concurrently.
 *
 * Concurrency & runtime-cost:
 *   - Per-thread ring + scratch pool (thread_local). A single submitting
 *     thread saturates only ~10 GiB/s on a 4-disk RAID0; multiple worker
 *     threads (e.g. one per GPU) each get their own ring and submit
 *     concurrently with no lock/contention, reaching the array's limit.
 *   - The ring (QD=1024) and pool are created lazily on a thread's first
 *     batch and reused for its lifetime; no per-call setup/teardown.
 *   - slice/iovec scratch is a fixed per-thread pool, so the hot path
 *     performs no malloc.
 *
 * Buffer handling: requests carry already-resolved host addresses (GPU
 * P2P VMA or CPU buffer). We deliberately use the *non-fixed* OP_READ /
 * OP_READV path (not registered buffers / READ_FIXED): it goes through the
 * same O_DIRECT DIO path as pread — which already works for phxfs GPU
 * VMAs — and avoids taking a second FOLL_LONGTERM pin on device pages.
